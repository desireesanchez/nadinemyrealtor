    <p>
      The Inland Empire is one of the fastest growing real estate markets in Southern California because it is both highly transparent and affordable. As a result, it is a hot location for people looking to buy their first home or invest in property within proximity to its up-and-coming areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buying real estate is a big step, hard-earned and well-deserved. You deserve to go forth in confidence, knowing what to expect and how to best prepare to buy your first home.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is typically what your homebuying experience will look like:

      <p>01</p>

      Get pre-approved with a lender to see how you can qualify for a mortgage
    </h2>
    <hr style="width:6em;"/>

    <p>
      As your Realtor, you will benefit from my close relationships with various lenders and vendors. To begin, we will meet with a lender to learn which price range you qualify for, how much you will need for a down payment, determine the actual monthly payment you can afford and overall which programs best fit your needs. To get ready for this, prepare and bring:
    </p>

    <ul class="textlist">
      <li>
        2 month’s bank statements
      </li>
      <li>
        2 year’s tax returns
      </li>
      <li>
        2 year’s W2s/1099s
      </li>
      <li>
        1 month’s paycheck
      </li>
      <li>
        Drivers license
      </li>
      <li>
        Social security card
      </li>
      <li>
        Any awards letters received
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As you anticipate this meeting, it is best to save at least 3.5% down plus an additional $1,000 for home inspection and appraisal costs. The lender may have programs available to help you save money by assisting with closing costs and down payments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout this process, you must demonstrate financial responsibility. Avoid vacations, large purchases, or large bank deposits leading up to or during the buying process. It is best to practice consistency in your deposits and payments, as this will be reviewed by the lending underwriter.
